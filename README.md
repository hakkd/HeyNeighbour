# Hey Neighbour
Imagine a community where no one feels alone or overwhelmed. Our web app connects volunteers with neighbors in need, whether it's help with groceries, yard work, or just a friendly conversation. As a non-profit, we aim to strengthen neighborhood ties and support our most vulnerable individuals. By bringing people together, we’re not just offering a helping hand—we’re building a culture of care, kindness, and connection. Join us in making a difference—one neighbor at a time!
